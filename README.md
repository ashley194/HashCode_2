# HashCode_2
I'm creating a HashCode Tester using SHA-256
I need to include 4 variables, which are:
1. Employer sort code (i.e. 112233)
2. Employee sort code (i.e. 445566)
3. Employee's NET pay (i.e. 1000.01)
4. Hash Code Random Number (i.e. /.GL)

1st step: The program needs the user to input the employers sort code

2nd step: The program needs the user to input the employees sort code

3rd step: The program needs the user to input the employees NET pay

4th step: The program needs the user to input the 'Hash Code Random Number', generated by the payroll system.

Once all necessary data has been entered, the program has enough information to generate the hash256 code.

There will also be a function, whereby you can enter a BACS hash code generated from your payroll system. That way, when you click the 'Compare' button, it will compare the BACS hash code generated by this program & compare the BACS has code generated by the payroll system. Hopefully, both BACS hash codes will agree or if not display 'No match'.

There will also be a function/button called 'Generate' which will generate the BACS hash code.

Once all functions have been completed, there will be a function/button called 'Clear All'; which will clear all the data entered on the screen. This will enable you to start the whole process again.
