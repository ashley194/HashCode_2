# HashCode_2
I'm trying to create a HashCode Tester using Hash 256
I need to include 3 variables, which are:
1. Employer sort code (i.e. 112233)
2. Employee sort code (i.e. 445566)
3. Employee's NET pay (i.e. 1000.01)

1st step: The program needs the user to input the employers sort code
2nd step: The program needs the user to input the employees sort code
3rd step: The program needs the user to input the employees NET pay
After that, the program has enough information to generate the hash256 code
There will also be a function, whereby you can enter a BACS hash code generated from your payroll system. That way, when you click the 'Compare' button, it will compare the BACS hash code generated by this program & compare the BACS has code generated by the payroll system.
